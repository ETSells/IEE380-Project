# IEE380-Project
Source code for my final project for IEE380: Probability and Statistics for Engineers.

To run this code for yourself, you need:
- Python, pip, and all of the libraries from the top of the python file.
- libcurl (I used visual studio to handle the linking, this is probably simplest)
