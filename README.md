# IEE380-Project
Source code for my final project for IEE380: Probability and Statistics for Engineers.

To run this code for yourself, you need:
- Python and the Requests library
- Some C compiler (like gcc) and libcurl (I used Visual Studio to handle compilation and linking, this is probably the simplest way)
