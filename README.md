# IEE380-Project
Source code for my final project for IEE380: Probability and Statistics for Engineers. Much of the code for the C part comes from the libcurl documentation, it's not fully original. The focus of this project is the data output, not the source code itself. The Python part comes from a personal project.

To run this code for yourself, you need:
- Python and the Requests library
- Some C compiler (like gcc) and libcurl (I used Visual Studio to handle compilation and linking, this is probably the simplest way)
